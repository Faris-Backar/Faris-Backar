# üí´ About Me:
üî≠  I'm currently working on building a full-stack Mobile Application using Flutter for the front-end mobile application and Java Spring for the back-end API.<br>üëØ I'm interested in collaborating on projects that involve building beautiful and performant user interfaces, integrating with APIs, and using state management solutions like Provider or Bloc. I'm also open to contributing to open source projects, especially those that are beginner-friendly and have a welcoming community.<br>ü§ù As a beginner in java spring boot I'm looking for guidance on best practices for handling async operations, as well as recommendations for popular libraries or packages to use for this purpose.<br>üå± Right now, I'm focusing on learning more about advanced Flutter animations and custom widgets, as well as exploring the Java Spring framework's support for microservices and reactive programming. I'm also experimenting with popular Flutter state management solutions like Riverpod and MobX.<br>üí¨ I'm particularly passionate about using Flutter to build performant and engaging mobile experiences, and I enjoy experimenting with new UI designs and animations. I'm also experienced in integrating Firebase services into Flutter projects, such as Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Functions.<br>‚ö° Fun fact: Did you know that Flutter was used to build the official Hamilton app, which features exclusive content, interactive experiences, and a digital lottery for tickets to the hit Broadway musical? Additionally, Google's Flutter team has created several fun and educational apps to showcase the power of Flutter, such as Flutter Clock and Flutter Gallery.
